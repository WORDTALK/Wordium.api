Languages, Dialects, and Labels
<p>
  Over here at sunny (and dry) Wordset headquarters, we've been quietly chugging
  away working on our <a href="https://github.com/wordset/wordset/wiki/V2-Roadmap">
  Wordset 2.0 milestones.</a> These changes aren't about big visual updates to the
  site or new buttons to hit everywhere. What we're doing is setting the stage
  for Wordset to start equitably and fairly cataloguing language. That's why
  we're adding support for multiple languages, dialect tagging, and usage labels.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the code now supports multiple languages. You may have noticed that we recently changed the URLs
  of words from "/word/sushi" to "/en/sushi", so that we can use one website to handle all the languages we want to support. 
  There are still some technical edge cases to work out, but the real thing we need
  to launch our second language is volunteers! Unfortunately, we only speak
  English natively. So we need native and fluent speakers of other languages
  to help do the hard work of getting a first version of other languages going. If you or someone you know
  would be willing to help, we have <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Vg6U0t3pL3g1k01Yl9YQXEErIjHVfSAXVdeI6N5nZlU/viewform">a quick form about contributing</a>
  that we'd love for you to fill out!
</p>

  Dialects are important to us. One of the founders speaks British English,
  the other American English, and so we can't just go around making
  a dictionary that only supports one of those! But we also know that language
  is far more varied than just the two major branches of English. There are dialects
  like Canadian English and AAVE â€“ dialects that are too often overlooked in dictionaries.
  We don't want to be like that, so we're adding in support for tagging meanings
  in these various groups:
</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>American
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English">AAVE</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_English">Canada</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">US</a></li>
      <ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations">British</a>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_English">South Africa</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English">Ireland</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">UK</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_English">India</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English">Australia</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_English">New Zealand</a></li>
      <ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  It's not a perfect dialect representation, but we think it will work well enough
  for now. We're also introducing other labels for words that can help with usage.
  Here's our initial set of non-dialect labels:
</p>
<div>
  <dl>
    <dt>Technical</dt>
    <dd>Terms or meanings of terms particular to specific professional disciplines.</dd>
    <dt>Scientific</dt>
    <dd>Words specific to scientific disciplines, for example physics or chemistry.</dd>
    <dt>Medical</dt>
    <dd>Terms that refer to various conditions or parts of the human body, devices used in medical treatment and so on.</dd>
    <dt>Legal</dt>
    <dd>Words that have a specific meaning in a legal context.</dd>
    <dt>Formal</dt>
    <dd>Words that are typically used in a more serious setting, often to indicate a certain expertise, for example in job application or an academic essay.</dd>
    <dt>Idiom</dt>
    <dd>An expression whose meaning cannot be inferred from the meanings of the words that make it up. In other words, phrases that would make an English learner go "huh?" The British idiom "for donkey's years" meaning "for a long time" is a good example. </dd>
    <dt>Archaic</dt>
    <dd>Words that aren't used anymore and/or words that have an older meaning that is no longer in popular use.</dd>
    <dt>Informal</dt>
    <dd>Casual language used in everyday life, especially among friends and acquaintances.</dd>
    <dt>Slang</dt>
    <dd>All slang is informal. Particular to slag is its tendency to give common words alternate meanings, like dough for money and ace for awesome.</dd>
    <dt>Offensive</dt>
    <dd>Language that is likely to make its recipient feel disrespected, marginalized, or otherwise upset.</dd>
  </dl>

  Labels are super easy to propose on meanings right now... just click the
  edit meaning button and select what labels you would like to apply.
</p>

<p>
  This is the first part of our dialect addition. We're now working on having multiple spellings of words too.
  This will help you find words you aren't sure how to spell, as well as help us compile a list of the most common misspellings.
</p>

<p>
  Now that you've got all the latest intel, feel free to go out there and start labeling! You can taken part in the
  current <a href="http://www.wordset.org/project/54f4fd486461370003000000">parentheses roundup</a>, pick a
  <a href="http://www.wordset.org/words/en/random">random word</a>, or go after whatever word you want with the 
  search bar above. Happy wordsetting :)

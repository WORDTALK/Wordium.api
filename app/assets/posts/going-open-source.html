Going Open Source
<p>
  We’ve only been launched for a month and already the response has been terrific. We’ve had 55,082 votes on 42,614 different proposals. Those kinds of numbers are just wacky!
</p>
<p>
  One of the reasons we originally started this project was because we were dissatisfied with existing dictionaries, both open and copyrighted. Traditional copyrighted dictionaries are owned by large corporations and if you want to use them in your project, it requires negotiating with a corporate sales person and signing a contract. Both of the major open dictionaries have major flaws. Wiktionary is unstructured and hard to reuse and WordNet is mostly abandoned and closed off from collaboration.
</p>
<p>
  We realized we have both the skills and the opportunity to make that better.
</p>
<p>
  We’ve had endless discussions trying to figure out how to weigh our desire to be the more open alternative vs being able to actually fund this project. We love open source, but can you open source a website and still make enough money to sustain it? Why can’t we find many other examples of open sourced websites? What happens if a big company wants to use Wordset, shouldn’t we get paid something for that?  What about our belief in open source?
</p>
<p>
  Starting this project was never about making a ton of money. There was never a spreadsheet that showed us making millions. It was always about the passion for doing something good and something useful for the world. But we would also love to be able to turn this into a project that can pay the bills.
</p>
<p>
  It’s a careful balancing act to figure all of this out. We had fears of ruining the project because we can’t charge for things and therefore have no time to work on it. We had opposite fears of losing traction and community support if we keep everything closed.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, we’ve decided to both open source the dictionary itself and the software that runs it. Specifically, we’re going to be choosing the same CC license for the content as Wikipedia uses, CC-BY-SA. For the source code, we’re going to be using the MIT License, one of the most liberal licenses out there. In fact, go check out our source code, right now on our <a href="https://www.github.com/wordset" target="_blank">Github site.</a>
</p>
<p>
  What made our minds up? It’s the overriding belief to trust our guts and morals. We believe that open systems are better for everyone involved. Even the creators of that content. We don’t know a lot of websites that have successfully run as open source, but we don’t know a lot that failed either. And we’re happy to put our money where our mouth is and see if we can make this thing go.
</p>
<p>
  We still don’t know how we’re going to make revenue yet, but that’s something we have time to figure out. We are openly rejecting the idea that we have to choose between open systems and making a good living. We have faith that the path will become clear as we go on and that we’ll be better off by following what our hearts say.

  Thank you to all of our amazing community members. You have all inspired us so much, and driven us to make this project amazing. Now, we’re looking to you not only to help with building definitions, but building the site itself!

Varieties of English and Labels
<p>
  Varieties of English are important to us. One of the founders speaks British English,
  the other American English. So we can't just go around making
  a dictionary that only supports one of those! But we also know that the English language
  is far more varied than just the two major branches that most dictionaries support.
</p>
<p>
  Here at Wordset, we decided two just wasnâ€™t enough. We are making the best dictionary alive and that
  calls for the inclusion of varieties that are often overlooked. So we've added in support for tagging
  the following varieties of English:
</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>American
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English">AAVE</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_English">Canada</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">US</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations">British</a>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_English">South Africa</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English">Ireland</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">UK</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_English">India</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English">Australia</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_English">New Zealand</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  It's not a perfect representation, but we think it will work well enough
  for now. We're also introducing other labels for words that can help with usage.
  Here's our initial set of non-variety labels:
</p>
<div>
  <dl>
    <dt>Technical</dt>
    <dd>Terms or meanings of terms particular to specific professional disciplines.</dd>
    <dt>Scientific</dt>
    <dd>Words specific to scientific disciplines, for example physics or chemistry.</dd>
    <dt>Medical</dt>
    <dd>Terms that refer to various conditions or parts of the human body, devices used in medical treatment and so on.</dd>
    <dt>Legal</dt>
    <dd>Words that have a specific meaning in a legal context.</dd>
    <dt>Formal</dt>
    <dd>Words that are typically used in a more serious setting, often to indicate a certain expertise, for example in job application or an academic essay.</dd>
    <dt>Idiom</dt>
    <dd>An expression whose meaning cannot be inferred from the meanings of the words that make it up. In other words, phrases that would make an English learner go "huh?" The British idiom "for donkey's years" meaning "for a long time" is a good example. </dd>
    <dt>Archaic</dt>
    <dd>Words that aren't used anymore and/or words that have an older meaning that is no longer in popular use.</dd>
    <dt>Informal</dt>
    <dd>Casual language used in everyday life, especially among friends and acquaintances.</dd>
    <dt>Slang</dt>
    <dd>All slang is informal. Particular to slang is its tendency to give common words alternative meanings, like dough for money and ace for awesome.</dd>
    <dt>Offensive</dt>
    <dd>Language that is likely to make its recipient feel disrespected, marginalized, or otherwise upset.</dd>

  Labels are super easy to propose on meanings right now... just click the
  edit meaning button and select what labels you would like to apply.

<p>
  This is the first part of our English varieties addition. We're now working on having multiple spellings of words too.
  This will help you find words you aren't sure how to spell, as well as help us compile a list of the most common misspellings.
</p>

<p>
  Now that you've got all the latest intel, feel free to go out there and start labeling! You can take part in the
  current <a href="http://www.wordset.org/project/54f4fd486461370003000000">parentheses roundup</a>, pick a
  <a href="http://www.wordset.org/words/en/random">random word</a>, or go after whatever word you want with the
  search bar above. Happy wordsetting :)

Palabraset? Wortset? Motset? – Expanding beyond English
<p>Wordset is expanding fast. We've got a lot of great people helping on projects, improving definitions, and adding example sentences. All of this is to help build the first open, collaborative English dictionary.</p>

<p>English isn’t the only language, though. We want to expand as soon as possible into other languages, but unfortunately Hampton and I only speak one.</p>

<p>That's why we’re looking for volunteers to help us expand into new target languages (TLs). Here's some of the ways in which you could help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help choose an open-sourced starting set of words in the TL</li>
  <li>help us understand the TL and any extra features that may need to be included in the UI/API</li>
  <li>translate Wordset's buttons into the TL</li>
  <li>foster a community around the TL by tweeting and encouraging edits</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can help, please fill out <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/dBFsVzA7EU">a form explaining which language(s) you could help out with</a>. We've listed out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers">top 20 languages</a> according to Wikipedia, but would be open to other languages if the interest and community is there.</p>

<p>Note that as well as the target language, you would have to be familiar with English in order to communicate with Hampton and me (but I assume that if you're reading this, that won't be too much of a problem).</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing which languages we'll tackle next!</p>

<p>– Hampton and Michael</p>

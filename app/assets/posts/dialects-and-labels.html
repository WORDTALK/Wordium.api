Languages, Dialects, and Labels
<p>
  Over here at sunny (and dry) Wordset headquarters, we've been quietly chugging
  away working on our <a href="https://github.com/wordset/wordset/wiki/V2-Roadmap">
  Wordset 2.0 milestones.</a> These changes aren't about big visual updates to the
  site or new buttons to hit everywhere. What we're doing is setting the stage
  for Wordset to equitably and fairly start cataloguing language. That's why
  we're adding support for multiple languages, dialect tagging, and usage labels.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the code now supports multiple languages. You may have noticed that we recently changed the URLs
  of words from "/word/sushi" to "/en/sushi", so that we can provide the same
  website, but also eventually handle all the language codes we want. There are still
  some technical edge cases to work out on the site, but the real thing we need
  to launch in our second language is volunteers! We, unfortunately, only speak
  English natively, so we need native and fluent speakers of other languages
  to help do the hard work of getting a first version going. If you know someone
  who would be willing to help, we have <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Vg6U0t3pL3g1k01Yl9YQXEErIjHVfSAXVdeI6N5nZlU/viewform">a quick form about contributing</a>
  that we'd love for you to fill out!

  Dialects are important to us. One of the founders speaks British English,
  the other American English, and so we can't just go around making
  a dictionary that only supports one of those! But we also know that language
  is far more varied than just the two major branches of English. There are dialects
  like Canadian English and AAVE â€“ dialects that are too often overlooked in many dictionaries.
  We don't want to be like that, so we're adding in support for tagging meanings
  as these various groups:
</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>American
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">US</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_English">Canada</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English">AAVE</a></li>
      <ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations">British</a>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">UK</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English">Ireland</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_English">South Africa</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_English">India</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English">Australia</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_English">New Zealand</a></li>
      <ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>
  It's not a perfect dialect representation, but we think it will work well enough
  for now. We're also introducing other labels for words that can help with usage.
  Here's our initial set of non-dialect labels:
</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Informal</li>
    <li>Slang</li>
    <li>Offensive</li>
    <li>Archaic</li>
    <li>Idiom</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>
  Labels are super easy to propose on meanings right now... just click the
  edit meaning button and select what labels you would like to apply.
</p>

<p>
  This is the first part of our dialect addition. We're now working on having multiple spellings of words, too.

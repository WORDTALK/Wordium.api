Languages, Dialects, and Labels
<p>
  Over here at sunny (and dry) Wordset headquarters, we've been quietyly chugging
  away working on our <a href="https://github.com/wordset/wordset/wiki/V2-Roadmap">
  Wordset 2.0 milestones.</a> These changes aren't about big visual updates to the
  site or new buttons to hit everywhere, what we're doing is setting the stage
  for Wordset to equitably and fairly start cateloguing language. That's why
  we're adding support for multiple-languages, dialect tagging, and usage labels.

  Most of the code now supports multiple languages. We recently changed the URLs
  of the words from "/word/sushi" to "/en/sushi", so that we can provide the same
  website, and eventually handle all the language codes we want. There are still
  some technical edge cases to work out on the site, but the real thing we need
  to launch in our first language is volunteers! We, unfortunately, only speak
  English natively, so we need native and fluent speakers of other languages
  to help do the hard work of getting a first version going. If you know someone
  who would be willing to help, we have a quick form that we'd love for you to
  fill out!

  Dialects are important to us. Actually, one of the founders speaks British English,
  and the other American English, and so we can't just very well go around making
  a dictionary that only supports one of those! But, we also know that language
  is far more varied than just the two major branches of English. There are dialects
  like Canadian English and AAVE, that are often overlooked in many dictionaries and
  we don't want to be like that. So, we're adding in support for tagging meanings
  as these various groups:

  TABLE OF DATA

  It's not a perfect dialect representation, but we think it will work well enough
  for now. We're also introducing other labels for words that can help with usage.
  Here's our initial set of non-dialect labels:

  Labels are super easy to propose on meanings right now... just click the
  edit meaning button, and select what labels you would like to apply.
